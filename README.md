# Refactoring VBA Code for Stock Analysis 

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

#### 
An excel file was created with macros to assist Steve in his analysis of 12 stocks. Later Steve
discloses that he may want to expand the data in his analysis exponentially. I found that the
vba code initially written works well for those 12 but can be improved upon to accomodate his
data expansion needs.

### Background
I have been tasked with helping out Steve, a friend and recent finance graduate. Steve is
assisting his parents with analysis on green energy stock for invesment purposes. Although their
interests lies in only 1 particular green energy stock he has selected an additional 11 for
comparison analysis. After some review Steve loves the file but discloses he may want to look
at a larger range of stocks in the future.
