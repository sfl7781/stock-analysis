# Refactoring VBA Code for Stock Analysis 

## Overview of Project
#### Purpose
An excel file was created with macros to assist Steve in his analysis of 12 stocks. Later Steve
discloses that he may want to expand the data in his analysis exponentially. I found that the
vba code initially written works well for those 12 but can be improved upon to accomodate his
data expansion needs.

#### Background
I have been tasked with helping out Steve, a friend and recent finance graduate. Steve is
assisting his parents with analysis on green energy stock for invesment purposes. Although their
interests lies in only 1 particular green energy stock he has selected an additional 11 for
comparison analysis. After some review Steve loves the file but discloses he may want to look
at a larger range of stocks in the future.
